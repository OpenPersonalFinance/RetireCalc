      <p>Withdrawal rate is the percentage of your networth you plan to use each year after retirement to meet your spending needs.  </p>
    
      <p>For Example, if you spend $40,000 a year and you have a withdrawal rate of 4%, then you would need a networth of $1,000,000 to meet spending needs.  If you want withdrawal 3% of you networth to meet your needed $40,000 then you would need a larger networth of $1,333,333.</p>
    
      <p>Choosing a different rate can change how much you need to save for retirement.</p>
      <p>$40,000 / 3% = $1,333,333</p>
      <p>$40,000 / 4% = $1,000,000</p>
      <p>$40,000 / 5% = $800,000</p>
    
      <p>Based on the Trinity Study, a withdrawal rate of 4% gives a retiree a 96% chance of having enough money for a 30 year retirement.  In fact in many of the experiments the retiree not only had enough money for 30 years, the money actually grew such that that they had enough money a much longer retirement.</p>
      <p>A withdrawal rate of 4% is used as a rule of thumb for many finacial advisors and is often called the "4% rule" or the "4% Safe Withdrawal Rate".  Of course it isn't perfect.  There are some problems with the 4% rule and many assumptions that went into the Trinity Study.</p>
