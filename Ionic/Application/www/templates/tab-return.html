    <p>Over the last 100 years the average return of the stock market has been around 11%, before expenses such as taxes, investment fees and inflation.  This is known as the nominal return. After you have adjusted for these expenses you are left with your real return</p>
    <p>On average inflation has been around 3% per year.  So you can do a quick calculation by subtracting inflation from the nominal return to get an expected return of 7%.  This isn't the actual formula to account for inflation, but it is close enough for our purpose.</p>
    <p>There is no guarentee that the next 100 years will be anything like the last 100. Past performance does not predict future results.  However, this is the best information available.</p>
    <p>We have chosen a conservative return 5%.  Feel free to be more or less conservative in your estimate.</p>
